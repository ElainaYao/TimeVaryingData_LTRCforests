Description: Implements the conditional inference forest and random survival
  forest with Poisson splitting rule algorithm to modeling left-truncated right-censored
  data with time-invariant covariates, and (left-truncated) right-censored survival data
  with time-varying covariates. It also provides functions to tune the parameters and
  evaluate the model fit are provided. See Yao et al. (2020) <arXiv:1901.04599>.
